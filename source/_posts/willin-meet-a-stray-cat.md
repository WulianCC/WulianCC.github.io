First met was last weekend, this poor guy was hesitating at the door to my cell.

I have no idea whether she's in pregnant, because of the potbelly. She followed me almost till home.

It have be rainy for days. When I saw her again this night, I made a decision to breed her.

I name her **团团 (Tuantuan)**. And from this day on, she is my family.
